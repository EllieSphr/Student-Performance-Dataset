I used "Student Performance" dataset from Kaggle. This multivariate dataset has a usability rating of 10/10. The dataset was complete, there were no null values and no duplicate values. The data was collected from 2 secondary schools in Portugal by using school questionnaires and reports. Grades, demographic, social, and school-related attributes are accounted for in the 33 columns available for analysis. 
The primary objective of this analysis is to determine whether there is a statistically significant correlation between students' final grades and the chosen variables. The variables under consideration include mother and father's occupation, mother and father's education, health, family size, failure, travel time, study time, extra paid classes, and weekend alcohol consumption.
The rationale behind this analysis is that these factors could influence a student's academic performance. For example, a supportive family environment, higher parental education, or more study time might positively impact a student's grades. Conversely, factors like past failures or long travel times could negatively affect academic outcomes.
